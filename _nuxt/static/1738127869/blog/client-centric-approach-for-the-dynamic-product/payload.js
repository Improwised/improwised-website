Centralized Storage with Shared File System\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EUse a shared file system (e.g., NFS, Ceph, or AWS EFS) that is accessible to all Traefik instances.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EConfigure Traefik to use the shared file system as the storage backend for ACME certificates by specifying the acme.json file location.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EExample configuration in traefik.yml:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003EcertificatesResolvers:\n  letsEncrypt:\n    acme:\n      email: \"your-email@example.com\"\n      storage: \"\u002Fshared\u002Facme.json\"\n      httpChallenge:\n        entryPoint: \"web\"\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E\u003C\u002Fpre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003E2. Use a Distributed Key-Value Store\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ETraefik supports using distributed key-value stores like Consul, Etcd, or Redis to store ACME certificates.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThis ensures that all instances have consistent access to certificate data and can avoid conflicts.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EExample configuration for Consul:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003EcertificatesResolvers:\n  letsEncrypt:\n    acme:\n      email: \"your-email@example.com\"\n      storage: \"traefik\u002Facme\u002Faccount\"\n      httpChallenge:\n        entryPoint: \"web\"\nproviders:\n  consul:\n    endpoints:\n      - \"127.0.0.1:8500\"\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E\u003C\u002Fpre\u003E\n\u003Ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003E3. Avoid Simultaneous Renewal Attempts\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EUse a leader-election mechanism (e.g., Kubernetes leader-election or a similar process in other environments) to designate a single Traefik instance as the one responsible for certificate renewal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ENon-leader instances can still use the certificates but do not attempt renewal.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003E4.
