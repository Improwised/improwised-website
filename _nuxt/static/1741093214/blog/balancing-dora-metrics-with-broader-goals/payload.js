It defines five maturity levels&mdash;Learn, Crawl, Walk, Run, and Fly&mdash;guiding organizations from initial exploration to full-scale cloud-native operations. The model emphasizes iterative improvements, enabling teams to progressively enhance automation, security, scalability, and reliability. It also highlights the importance of DevOps practices, continuous delivery, declarative infrastructure, and GitOps.

Development and operations teams operate in silos, with limited collaboration. Infrastructure provisioning, application deployments, and environment configurations are executed manually, often relying on individual expertise rather than documented processes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ETechnical workflows lack standardization, leading to environment drift and configuration inconsistencies. Monitoring and logging solutions, if present, are fragmented, making incident resolution reactive and time-intensive. Version control for infrastructure code is not enforced, resulting in undocumented changes and elevated risk of outages. Organizations at this level typically face prolonged deployment cycles, frequent production failures, and high operational overhead due to repetitive manual tasks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003ELevel 2: Standardized Foundations\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EOrganizations at this level establish basic consistency in toolchains and processes. Cross-functional teams adopt a common set of tools for source control, such as Git, and implement rudimentary automation scripts for provisioning cloud resources or deploying applications. Infrastructure configurations begin to transition from manual setups to declarative templates, though these may not yet be fully version-controlled or tested.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ECentralized logging and monitoring systems, such as Elasticsearch or Prometheus, are deployed to aggregate metrics and logs. However, alerting mechanisms remain underdeveloped, and incident response processes are not systematically enforced. Security practices, such as network policies or access controls, are applied inconsistently across environments.

Policy as Code frameworks, such as Open Policy Agent, enforce organizational rules for resource quotas, cost management, and compliance. Observability stacks correlate metrics, logs, and traces across microservices, enabling proactive performance optimization.
