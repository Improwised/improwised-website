Monitoring and logging solutions, if present, are fragmented, making incident resolution reactive and time-intensive. Version control for infrastructure code is not enforced, resulting in undocumented changes and elevated risk of outages. Organizations at this level typically face prolonged deployment cycles, frequent production failures, and high operational overhead due to repetitive manual tasks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003ELevel 2: Standardized Foundations\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EOrganizations at this level establish basic consistency in toolchains and processes.

However, alerting mechanisms remain underdeveloped, and incident response processes are not systematically enforced. Security practices, such as network policies or access controls, are applied inconsistently across environments.

Automated testing frameworks validate infrastructure changes and application functionality before deployment, reducing regression risks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EMonitoring systems evolve to include real-time dashboards and anomaly detection, with tools like Grafana or Datadog providing visibility into system performance.

Its declarative nature, while powerful, can introduce complexity, particularly for smaller teams or those new to this deployment model. Grasping OAM's components, traits, and policies requires a deeper understanding. Integrating OAM with other deployment strategies, such as Blue\u002FGreen or Continuous Deployment, can enhance its capabilities but also adds layers of complexity that must be effectively managed. Furthermore, while OAM's ability to define multiple workloads within a single specification can improve scalability, it necessitates careful management to prevent system overload.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOperationalizing OAM can have significant consequences. Strategies like Recreate deployments, if not carefully managed, can lead to significant downtime, negatively impacting user experience and disrupting business operations. Techniques like Blue\u002FGreen and Shadow deployments require running multiple application versions concurrently, which can increase resource consumption, including storage, computing power, and hardware costs. Continuous Deployment, while enabling rapid deployments, heavily relies on robust automated testing and validation. Any deficiencies in these processes can result in deploying faulty code to production, potentially causing service disruptions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ESelecting the appropriate deployment strategy is critical.
